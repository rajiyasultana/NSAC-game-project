# OceanQuest - Explore, Learn, and Protect Our Oceans
Welcome to OceanQuest, an interactive learning game that simplifies and engages students with satellite data from NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem). Built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, this game turns complex environmental data into an immersive experience, empowering players to explore real-world issues like ocean health, climate change, and pollution.

## Introduction
OceanQuest is designed to bring NASA’s PACE satellite data to life, making it accessible and fun for students and educators. In this game, players embark on a mission to explore Earth’s oceans, track pollution, monitor phytoplankton growth, and protect marine ecosystems using real satellite data. The game incorporates augmented reality (AR) and dynamic animations to offer a unique, engaging learning experience.

## Features
- Interactive Gameplay: Players take on missions, make decisions, and solve challenges based on real-world satellite data.
- Augmented Reality (AR): Brings ocean data to life in 3D, allowing players to visualize ocean currents, phytoplankton blooms, and environmental changes in their surroundings.
- Educational Content: Teaches players about the impact of climate change, pollution, and ocean health through engaging visuals and simulations.
- Real-Time Data Integration: Uses simplified PACE satellite data for an authentic learning experience.

## Gameplay
In OceanQuest, players explore various ocean regions, analyze satellite data, and make decisions to protect the environment. Key gameplay elements include:
- Exploring ocean ecosystems: Navigate through oceans, tracking pollution levels and monitoring marine life.
- Interactive missions: Complete challenges based on real PACE data, like reducing ocean pollution or promoting phytoplankton growth.
- Augmented reality: Use AR to visualize environmental changes and their effects on the ecosystem around you.
